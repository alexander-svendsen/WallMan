Notes for the project

Start Up:
How to start this. First problem is to actually have the game,
Lets start by making the game on one pc. When the game is up and
running then i can move on to having two screens for the game
one for each python window where they are connected and only 
displaying what i`m telling it too. So in other words a third python
program for communicating the commands 

how it should look: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uswzriFIf_k
TODO (Adding more as i move along): 
	- Make a simple Pac-Man game, where the layout it decides by the level design file (Gonna take a while)
		- Remember the support for multiplayer as well (No Idea how at this moment)
	- Split the game up, and display the game pr pygame window running at a time
		- Still run the game only by having a centrilized controler for the total game
		- Game control then need to be modular and use nettwork communication, Can use whatever you want as long as you follow the api 
	- From here performence stuff is tried out (Think about this when we are there)



[] Make a simple Pac-Man game, where the layout it decides by the level design file (Gonna take a while)
    OPTIONAL make a menu
	- Make the pices bigger depending on the size of the screen
		- Only if the game lvl, is not big enough for the whole screen
			-> What if the level is to big ?
			-> What to do if the packman is so large that he is displayed over multiple windows
	- Make the graphics separete from the game objects, so that I can change them if I feel like it

	- game Layout is a two dimensional array?
	- think the graphics for the figures should be the same

Funny Features tought of:
	- Add sound (Is it possible to do this on the display wall?)
	- Dominence fight ^^
    - controll players by a javascript page
    - Make a game path generator, to support all screens

Side IDEAS to improve code for future generations:
    - What about simply making a distributed pygame surface (Jhon Markus Master?)
        - Can't lock part of the screens
        - what if some windows aren't connected
        - Can't have some windows with somethign to display and some not
